1. go to https://gota.io/web/ (do not join a server until step 4)
2. open chrome inspector with "F12" or "Control + Shift +  i"
3. go to "Network" tab is chrome inspector (see image1)
4. get a skin name and join a server with a relatively low number of players (or you will get many skins and you won't know which one is yours; remember you have to keep  the inspector open)
5.and  once you joined you will see some codes like in image2 -> 1. (image2 -> 2 is the a link where you can  see a preview of the image)
6. copy 1 from image 2 without ".png"  and that is the skin code
